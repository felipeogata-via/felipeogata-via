# 👋 Hello! Welcome to My Codeverse

I'm [Seu Nome], a passionate **C# developer** with a knack for making business logic click – especially when it comes to **payments** and **refunds**. I’ve got the logic for cash flow running through my veins! 💸

### 🌐 A Bit of Background

I started my journey in **Data Science**, diving deep into everything from **data poisoning** defenses to using **AI for world geopolitics** 🌍. And yes, I'm always looking for that next big leap in tech – currently exploring **Unity** (anyone up for a platformer or a shoot 'em up?). 

#### 🛠️ The Skills Arsenal

- **C#**: My bread and butter for solving complex payment issues.
- **Data Science & AI**: From building models to understanding AI's influence in modern business and geopolitics.
- **Unity Beginner**: Recently downloaded the "2D Platformer Microgame" – I’m already hooked!

#### 🚀 Current Project

- **Project Extension**: Focused on **poverty eradication**, following the UN's SDGs. If you have Dreamshaper tips, I'm all ears!
- **Game Dev Adventure**: Creating a WWI-themed shoot 'em up game – **Skyward Offensive: Project Zero**. Aliens, giant enemies, and a battle for Earth? Check.

### 🎯 Mission

To fuse creativity with logic, whether that means designing game mechanics or building seamless payment systems. If it involves tech, problem-solving, or a touch of adventure, I’m there!
